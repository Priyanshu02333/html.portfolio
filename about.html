<h1>About Me</h1>

  "Diving into web development with unwavering passion, I'm an aspiring software enthusiast with a year of design experience at TSR. I've earned merit scholarships twice during my college journey, showcasing my dedication to excellence. Additionally, I've secured 2nd rank at the institute level in Smart India Hackathon (SIH) for the best idea presentation on a problem given by ministries of India. Eager to turn code into captivating experiences, I seek an internship opportunity to immerse myself in real-world challenges, hone my technical skills, and pave the way for a promising career in tech.".</p>
